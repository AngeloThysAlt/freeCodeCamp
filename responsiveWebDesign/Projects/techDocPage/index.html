            <header>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</header>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document
                written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements
                should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>
            <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C
                specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done
                synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about
                CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without
                a version number.</p>
            <p>After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS
                modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations
                separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a
                snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS
                modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5.</p>

            <h3>CSS Introduction</h3>
            <p>If you're new to web development, be sure to read our CSS basics article to learn what CSS is and how to
                use it.</p>
            <h3>CSS Tutorials</h3>
            <p>Our CSS learning area contains a wealth of tutorials to take you from beginner level to proficiency,
                covering all the fundamentals.</p>
            <h3>CSS Reference</h3>
            <p>Our exhaustive CSS reference for seasoned Web developers describes every property and concept of CSS.</p>

            <p>Our CSS Learning Area features multiple modules that teach CSS from the ground up — no previous knowledge
                required.</p>
            <h3>CSS first steps</h3>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font,
                color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
                decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the
                basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to
                HTML.</p>
            <h3>CSS building blocks</h3>
            <p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity with the language
                and its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This module
                looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling
                backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.</p>
            <p>The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the
                essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.</p>
            <h3>CSS styling text</h3>
            <p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text
                — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including
                setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We
                round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.</p>
            <h3>CSS layout</h3>
            <p>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and
                manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in
                the right place in relation to the viewport, and to each other. We have covered the necessary
                prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern
                layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might still
                want to know about.</p>
            <h3>Use CSS to solve common problems</h3>
            <p>This module provides links to sections of content explaining how to use CSS to solve common problems when
                creating a web page.</p>

            <p>The CSS layout cookbook aims to bring together recipes for common layout patterns, things you might need
                to implement in your sites. In addition to providing code you can use as a starting point in your
